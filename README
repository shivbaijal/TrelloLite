# Trello Lite

Trello Lite is a simple Trello iOS client with a single task focused approach.

Trello is really great for long term project planning. 

But sometimes I just want to focus on the present, so I built this app so that I can focus on one task at a time, whilst still making progress on my long term goals.

At the moment, I've not yet added OAuth support, so you will need to add your own API key and OAuth token to use the app, see https://trello.com/docs/gettingstarted/index.html for more details on how to get these.

**TODO:**

* OAuth support
* The Trello API can occasionally get slow, so I need to add data storage
* Generalize the design / add multiple list support. The app currently only shows you the first list for every board, as it's currently designed for my own use case (I tend to use boards' first list for short-term work, and I use the other lists for future planning)
